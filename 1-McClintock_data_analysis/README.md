<h1Y chromosome analysish1>

The pairwise divergences were calculated from Mega X from alignments available on Dryad.

- The pairwise calculations were made for all G2/Jockey-3 and then separated for their respective chromosomes

- Y_Contig26_iso1_mod.txt and Y_Contig26.iso1.clades.txt are slightly modified gff files with class information for G2/Jockey-3 or other elements
