<h1>Age and Age-of-Allele Test Analysis<h1>

<h2>Notes<h2> 

1. DGRP3_all_math_output.csv is the output of the Age-of-allele test
	- The age of allele test is run from FileS3_test.nb in the following publication
		- "An Age-of-Allele Test of Neutrality for Transposable Element Insertions"
		- Link to the paper: [https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.113.158147](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.113.158147)

2. Unique substitutions from a multiple sequence alignment file were quantified with ```out_unique_subs.R```

3. Alignment files can be found on Dryad

4. ```dmel_scaffold2_plus0310_chromatin.txt``` is a modification of the ```TableS11.dmel_scaffold2_plus0310_context_without.csv``` from the McClintock pipeline and Chang et al 2019
	
5. ```dmel_scaffold2_plus0310_2.fasta.out.G2.info.txt``` is a modified GFF file with unique substitutions and chromatin state included
